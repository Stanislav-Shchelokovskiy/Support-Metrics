For questions, "Lifetime Time" is defined as the median amount of time between the very first iteration start and the last iteration end (that is, the first customer question and last our reply).<br>
For bugs, it is the median amount of time between ticket creation date and date we fixed it or closed it (without a fix).<br>
Other types of tickets are ignored.<br>
We take into account only tickets closed for more than 3 weeks and other applied filters.
