For <b>questions</b>, "Ticket Lifetime" is defined as the median amount of time (in minutes) between the initial customer inquiry and our final response, encompassing all iterations in between.<br>

For <b>bugs</b>, it is defined as the median period between the date the ticket was created and the date we either resolved it or closed it without a fix.<br>

<b>Important notes</b>:<br>
- Any other ticket types are disregarded/ignored.<br>
- We only consider tickets that have been closed for over 3 weeks and apply other relevant filters.
