We collect only tickets created by customers. Tickets created by employees or service users aren't collected.
The collected tickets have various fields we may need for various types of analysis.<br>
If there are 1+ iterations in a ticket, this ticket will also contain a list of all these iterations.<br>
Each iteration contains the following fields:
* emp_post_id <br>
It's used to uniquely identify the iteration. You may use it for grouping in the raw data.
* emp_name of employee who closed this iteration
* emp_position_name
* emp_tribe_name
